# Indie Wiki Buddy

Indie Wiki Buddy is a browser extension that automatically notifies and redirects you from wikis on large, corporate-run wiki farms to independent wikis.

This is a userscript that replicates Indie Wiki Buddy's extension version, but as a userscript. The only reason I'm making this instead of a extension is because, 1, you can see and edit the code at anytime, no matter what. And 2, this works on my phone as well because they don't have a mobile extension for iOS/iPad OS.

Currently, as of this push, this has **no functionality**, so please don't use it, I'll update this when I get to the point of it actually working, but right now I'm trying to make the extension code work as a userscript.

Um, so yeah, go support the original dev, since this is all his code frankenstiend with mine to make it work, and I don't care about being supported as this is an indie project.

So yeah, go support the main dev on Ko-fi <br>
